# Scalable UVC Box
A scalable box for mounting germicidal UVC lights to clean and maintain equipment
---
Note: This is not a medical device. While we have taken every effort to validate the principles behind this system, and use certified UV-C bulbs producing light at 254 nm, this is still a device that was kludged together by parts we already had on hand. We currently have no means to test its efficacy. For deployment in a medical environment, consider this an option of absolute last resort. 

Initially designed to help our local library sanitize books during the Covid-19 outbreak, this box provides a simple, scalable, system for building an ultraviolet germicidal chamber. It can be built quickly with commonly available components that can be found at most big box home improvement stores. In its current form, it has absolutely no safety features. Exposure to UV-C light can cause burns, damage your vision, or potentially blind you. Do not open the chamber with the light on without using proper protective equipment.

### Step 1: Assemble the Box

Cut the plywood to your deisred size, leaving an openning on one side cut into the face of the plywood. Create a light seal by glueing small strips of plywood to the edges around the opening. Decide which side of each panel will be the inside and cover the entire surface with reflective tape. Join the corners using the 3D printed corner braces to align drill holes. As you lock down each corner, seal all joints with reflective foil tape to prevent light leaks. 

### Step 2: Mount the door

Create a light seal by glueing more small strips of plywood around the door of the box such that they do not interfere with the seals around the opening. Cover the entire inner surface with reflective foil tape. Mount the door to the box using the 3D printed hinges. Attach the handle to a convenient point on the door. Glue or tape magnets in appropriate locations to keep the door securely shut. 

### Step 3: Electronics

Decide where you want the bulbs to be positioned within the box and mount the G23 sockets. Use the wiring diagram on the ballast to wire up the sockets. These sockets use a friction connection so you can get good contact by inserting the stripped, bare solid core wire into the receptacles. Mount the ballast on the back of the box. 

Connect a ground wire to the case of you ballast. Mount the power switch and then connect the mains using whichever connectors you have available, routing at least on end through the power switch. 

### Step 4: Seal and test

In a dark room, shine a standard buld through the box, looking for light leaks. Seal any leaks with foil tape. Pay close attention to the seams around the door. 

Once you are sure there is no light leaks, insert the germicidal bulbs, taking care not to touch the glass with bare skin. Close the lid, put on proper protective equipment, plug in the system, and turn it on. Do not look into the box without wearing approved safety goggles, avoid any UV exposure, and be safe! ALways switch off the UV-C lights before opening the chamber. 

### Final Notes

Again, a firm reminder that this is, at best, a tool of last resort when other, proven, decontamination systems are unavailable. In clinical trials UV-C light has been show to inactivate SARS-CoV after 40 minutes of exposure (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17002634). This device, however, has undergone no clinical testing.
